## Symptom

An agent (or a ported bash script) probes for a tool with `command -v foo` under
PowerShell. The probe prints nothing and the script concludes the tool is
missing — even though it is installed and on PATH. Installs get re-run,
bootstraps loop, "missing dependency" errors lie.

## Repro

```powershell
command -v git      # prints nothing, no error, $? stays true
Get-Command git     # works: CommandType Application, path shown
```

## Cause

PowerShell has no `command` builtin. Depending on parse context, `command -v git`
either matches nothing quietly or binds to unrelated tokens; it raises no error
and sets no useful exit state. The bash idiom fails in the WORST way: silently,
with a plausible-looking negative result.

## Workaround

- Probe with `Get-Command <tool> -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` (null check) or
  simply run `<tool> --version` and check `$LASTEXITCODE`.
- Agent prompts targeting Windows must map `command -v` → `Get-Command`; the
  referenced commit ships that rule as a documented shell-hazard contract.
