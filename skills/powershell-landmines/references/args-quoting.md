# Bun rejects powershell.exe argv containing -WindowStyle Hidden

## Symptom

PowerShell-based SID/process lookups and cleanup routines silently do nothing
under Bun on Windows. No error surfaces in the happy path; the spawn itself
failed before `-Command` ever ran.

## Repro

```js
// Bun 1.3.14, Windows
Bun.spawn(["powershell.exe", "-WindowStyle", "Hidden", "-Command", "whoami"]);
// spawn fails before PowerShell runs (#1589) — remove the -WindowStyle pair:
Bun.spawn(["powershell.exe", "-Command", "whoami"], { windowsHide: true }); // works
```

## Cause

A Bun 1.3.14 Windows spawn bug: the adjacent `"-WindowStyle", "Hidden"` argv
pair to `powershell.exe` makes process creation itself fail. Combined with the
flag being useless for console suppression anyway (see
windowstyle-hidden-vs-windowshide), keeping it in argv is all cost, no benefit.

## Workaround

- Strip `-WindowStyle Hidden` from every direct PowerShell argv; rely on
  `windowsHide: true` (CREATE_NO_WINDOW).
- Script-internal `Start-Process -WindowStyle Hidden` is a different construct
  and remains fine.
- The fix added a sweep test forbidding the argv pair across the codebase.

# -WindowStyle Hidden still flashes a console window

## Symptom

A background service launches `powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden -Command ...`
for a quick lookup, and users see a console window flash on screen anyway —
sometimes stealing focus mid-typing. The flag looks correct; the window appears
regardless.

## Repro

```powershell
# From a console-less parent (a GUI app or service):
powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden -Command "whoami"
# A new console window is allocated and briefly visible.
```

## Cause

`powershell.exe` is a console-subsystem binary. When its parent has no console,
Windows allocates a brand-new console at process creation — BEFORE PowerShell
ever parses `-WindowStyle Hidden`. The flag hides the window only after startup,
which is why it flashes. Suppression must happen at the Win32 level:
CREATE_NO_WINDOW (`windowsHide: true` in Node/Bun spawn options).

## Workaround

- Set `windowsHide: true` (CREATE_NO_WINDOW) in the spawning runtime; treat
  `-WindowStyle Hidden` as a cosmetic hint, not a suppression mechanism.
- The referenced production fix moved identity/CIM lookups to `windowsHide`
  after user-visible console flashes (#1236).

# The English word 'and' is not a statement separator

## Symptom

A user (or an agent-generated recovery message) pastes a line like
"remove the variable and set the new one" written as actual commands joined by
the word `and` — and PowerShell throws a baffling parameter-binding error on
the FIRST command, or silently binds `and` as an argument.

## Repro

```powershell
Remove-Item Env:CODEX_HOME -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue and $env:CODEX_HOME = "C:\new"
# 'and' plus everything after it binds into Remove-Item's argument list —
# one broken statement, not two commands.
```

## Cause

PowerShell has `-and` as a boolean operator inside expressions, but bare `and`
between commands is just another positional argument. Prose-style command
chaining parses as one statement. Documentation and agent prompts that render
"do X and do Y" as a single line produce copy-paste traps.

## Workaround

- Separate statements with `;` (unconditional) or check `$?`/use `if` for
  conditional chaining (5.1 has no `&&`).
- The referenced fix changed a shipped recovery one-liner from "... and ..." to
  "...; ..." exactly because users pasted it verbatim.

# Double-quoted regex interpolates \$vars — and backslash won't save you

## Symptom

A test asserts against a regex like `"SetEnvironmentVariable\(\$entries..."` in a
double-quoted string. Under `Set-StrictMode` it explodes with "variable
'\$entries' cannot be retrieved" — or worse, without StrictMode it silently
matches garbage because \$entries expanded to nothing.

## Repro

```powershell
Set-StrictMode -Version Latest
$text -match "pattern(\$entries -join)"
# ERROR: The variable '$entries' cannot be retrieved because it has not been set.
# The backslash did NOT escape the dollar — \ is not an escape char in PowerShell.
```

## Cause

Two habits from other languages collide: PowerShell interpolates `$var` inside
DOUBLE-quoted strings, and its escape character is the backtick — backslash has
no escaping power. A regex written for .NET/PCRE with `\$` still interpolates.
The variable expands at string-construction time, before the regex engine sees
anything.

## Workaround

- Write regexes that mention `$` in SINGLE quotes: `'pattern(\$entries)'` —
  no interpolation, backslash reaches the regex engine intact.
- If double quotes are unavoidable, escape with backtick: `"\`$entries"`.

# powershell -File refuses scripts that aren't named .ps1

## Symptom

A bootstrap downloads an installer script to a temp file and runs it with
`powershell -File $tmpfile`. On Windows it fails with "the file ... is not
recognized as a PowerShell script" — because the temp file was created with a
`.sh` (or extensionless) name by cross-platform code.

## Repro

```powershell
Copy-Item installer.ps1 installer.sh
powershell -File .\installer.sh
# Processing -File 'installer.sh' failed: the file does not have a '.ps1' extension.
```

## Cause

`powershell -File` / `pwsh -File` dispatch on the FILENAME EXTENSION, not the
content. Anything not ending in .ps1 is rejected before parsing. Cross-platform
download helpers that default temp suffixes to .sh silently arm this on the
Windows branch.

## Workaround

- Choose the temp suffix by target shell: `.ps1` when the launcher is
  PowerShell, `.sh` for POSIX. The referenced fix does exactly this
  (suffix = shell === 'powershell' ? 'ps1' : 'sh').

# Embedded quotes and empty args vanish before native commands see them

## Symptom

A native command receives mangled arguments: embedded double quotes are stripped,
empty-string arguments disappear entirely, JSON payloads arrive corrupted. The
PowerShell side looks correct; only the receiving program sees the damage.

## Repro

```powershell
node -e "console.log(JSON.stringify(process.argv.slice(1)))" '{"key": "value"}' ""
# Legacy argument passing: quotes stripped, empty arg dropped:
# ["{key: value}"]
```

## Cause

PowerShell historically rebuilt a command line string for native processes instead
of passing an argument vector, re-quoting by heuristic. PR #14692 introduced
`$PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing = 'Standard'` (7.2+) using .NET ArgumentList to
fix quotes/empty/space handling — and PR #15408 immediately had to carve out a
Windows legacy mode because some Windows CLIs (msiexec-style `KEY="value"`)
depended on the broken behavior. The trap is version- and platform-dependent.

## Workaround

- Pin behavior explicitly on 7.2+: `$PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing = 'Standard'`
  (or `'Legacy'` when a Windows CLI needs it).
- Pass complex payloads via files or stdin, never inline JSON arguments, when 5.1
  must be supported.
- Test argument round-trips on every runtime you claim to support.

# Joining command fragments with '; ' splits Start-Process mid-call

## Symptom

An elevation launcher builds one `Start-Process` invocation from string
fragments and joins them with `"; "`. The elevated process starts — but without
its arguments and without the UAC verb, so the elevated action silently does the
wrong thing (or nothing).

## Repro

```js
// Generator code building a PowerShell command line:
const cmd = ["Start-Process -FilePath 'app.exe'", "-ArgumentList 'install'", "-Verb RunAs"].join("; ");
// Produces: Start-Process -FilePath 'app.exe'; -ArgumentList 'install'; -Verb RunAs
// → Start-Process runs with NO args; the rest are separate (broken) statements.
```

## Cause

`;` is PowerShell's statement terminator. A generator that joins PARAMETER
fragments of one call with `"; "` inserts statement boundaries mid-command.
Each fragment after the first is parsed as a new statement starting with a
parameter token — a parse error at best, a silently degraded `Start-Process`
at worst.

## Workaround

- Join parameter tokens of a single call with spaces (or build an array and
  splat); place `;` only BETWEEN complete statements.
- The fix joined fragments with "" and kept `;` only after the complete
  `Start-Process ... -Wait`.
