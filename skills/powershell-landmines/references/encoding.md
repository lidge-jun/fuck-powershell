# A BOM-less .ps1 is read as ANSI — non-ASCII corrupts before execution

## Symptom

A script containing non-ASCII string literals (Korean paths, emoji, accented
names) behaves wrongly under Windows PowerShell 5.1: comparisons fail, files with
localized names are not found, output is mojibake. The same file runs perfectly
under pwsh 7. Console output "looking garbled" proves nothing — the corruption
happened at parse time.

## Repro

```powershell
# Save this WITHOUT a BOM as test.ps1 (UTF-8):   $s = "한글"; $s.Length
powershell.exe -File test.ps1   # 5.1 on a Korean host reads it as CP949: wrong Length
pwsh -File test.ps1             # 7: correct
```

The only reliable check is byte-level: inspect the literal's length/bytes, not how
the console renders it. This trap was documented as a hard rule for AI agents
writing Windows scripts (see ref): ".ps1 needs a UTF-8 BOM."

## Cause

Windows PowerShell 5.1 decides a script file's encoding by sniffing for a BOM.
No BOM means the legacy ANSI code page (CP949 on Korean systems, CP1252 on
Western ones). Every non-ASCII literal is corrupted before the script runs.
PowerShell 7 assumes UTF-8 by default, which is why the bug is invisible in
7-only testing — and why agents generating .ps1 files keep shipping it.

## Workaround

- Write .ps1 files as UTF-8 **with BOM** whenever 5.1 might run them.
- CI-lint your repo: any .ps1 containing non-ASCII bytes must start with EF BB BF.
- Verify with byte checks (`Format-Hex`, `$s.Length`), never with console output.

# Out-File writes UTF-16; your POSIX tools read garbage

## Symptom

A file generated in a Windows CI step looks fine in PowerShell but breaks every
downstream consumer: git shows the whole file changed, grep finds nothing, Node
or Python parse errors on "empty" content, diffs are full of `\x00`.

## Repro

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell 5.1
"hello" | Out-File hello.txt
# bytes: FF FE 68 00 65 00 ...   <- UTF-16LE with BOM
"hello" > hello2.txt              # same: > IS Out-File
```

## Cause

In Windows PowerShell 5.1, `Out-File` (and therefore the `>` redirection operator)
defaults to UTF-16LE with BOM. POSIX toolchains expect UTF-8 without BOM. The
referenced CI fix migrated a workflow to `Set-Content -Encoding utf8NoBOM` under
pwsh after Unicode content corrupted in the 5.1 lane. PowerShell 7 changed the
default to BOM-less UTF-8, so the same script writes different bytes per runtime.

## Workaround

- Always pass an explicit encoding: `Out-File -Encoding utf8` (5.1: writes BOM)
  or `Set-Content -Encoding utf8NoBOM` (7+).
- On 5.1, when you need BOM-less UTF-8, drop to .NET:
  `[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($path, $text)`.
- Lint generated artifacts for BOMs in CI.
